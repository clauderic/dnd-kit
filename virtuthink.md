## Plan A - Separate virtualized viewports

## Plan B - flatten lists to single container

## Plan C - centralized virtualization and lists - supports scroll

- We need deep linking
  for deep linking to work properly, we must have a way to calculate the position of the sub list + the item inside it.
  or, to add a method of asking the list for the position
- We need animations to work
