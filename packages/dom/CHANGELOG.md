### Patch Changes

- [`8530c12`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/8530c122c8db7723a8c13a207a11487b3354cb59) Thanks [@clauderic](https://github.com/clauderic)! - Fixed lifecycle related issues.

- [#1440](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1440) [`8e45c2a`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/8e45c2a9d750283296b56b05a887be89fe7b0184) Thanks [@clauderic](https://github.com/clauderic)! - Better handling of elements that have `transform` or `translate` applied. The Feedback and Sortable plugins now no longer need to ignore transforms as the `DOMRectangle` can compute the projected final coordinates of an element that has transforms applied even if it is currently being animated by looking at the last animation keyframe.
