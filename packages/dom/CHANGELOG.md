- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`94920c8`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/94920c8a7a3a15accfb806b52e4935637b1a0781) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Batch write operations to `draggable` and `droppable`. Also ensured that droppable instance is registered before draggable instance.

- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`a04d3f8`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/a04d3f88d380853b97585ab3b608561f7b02ce69) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Rework how collisions are detected and how the position of elements is observed using a new `PositionObserver`.

- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`0676276`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/0676276f5423dbb4e0cad738ac3784937dc7504b) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Children contained in a closed `details ` element are no longer treated as visible.

This can be useful if you want the collision detection to operate on a subset of the sortable element, but the entirety of the element to move when its index changes.

- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`fe76033`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/fe7603330fb4b0a397c0e2af641df94fc2879c35) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Fixed a bug in the `KeyboardSensor` that would cause the sensor to activate when focusing elements within the sortable element other than the handle.

- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`62a8118`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/62a81180c84f7782b14b69b56f891c810e7d0f69) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Added `Tab` to the list of default keycodes that end the current drag operation.

- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`f219549`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/f219549087d9100cee53ab0cf35d820fe256aa85) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Fix pointer events no longer being detected by the `PointerSensor` when the event target is disconnected from the DOM by setting pointer capture on the document body for `pointermove` events.

- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`bfc8ab2`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/bfc8ab21cfd9c16a8d90ab250386e6d52d0a40a3) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - **PointerSensor**: Defer invoking `setPointerCapture` until activation constraints are met as it can interfere with `click` and other event handlers. Also deferred adding `touchmove`, `click` and `keydown` event listeners until the activation constraints are met.

- [#1454](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1454) [`3fb972e`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/3fb972e228aabfe07d662b77c642405f909fddb0) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - **AccessibilityPlugin**: Force `tabindex="0"` in Safari even for natively focusable elements as they are not always focusable by default.

- [#1443](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1443) [`4dbcb1c`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/4dbcb1c87c34273fecf7257cd4cb5ac67b42d3a4) Thanks [@clauderic](https://github.com/clauderic)! - Fix bugs with PointerSensor when interacting with anchor or image elements.

- [#1443](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/pull/1443) [`794cf2f`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/794cf2f4bdeeb57a197effb1df654c7c44cf34a3) Thanks [@clauderic](https://github.com/clauderic)! - Removed `options` and `options.register` from `Entity` base class. Passing an `undefined` manager when instantiating `Draggable` and `Droppable` now has the same effect.

### Patch Changes

- [`8530c12`](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/commit/8530c122c8db7723a8c13a207a11487b3354cb59) Thanks [@clauderic](https://github.com/clauderic)! - Fixed lifecycle related issues.

The Feedback and Sortable plugins now no longer need to ignore transforms as the `DOMRectangle` can compute the projected final coordinates of an element that has transforms applied even if it is currently being animated by looking at the last animation keyframe.
