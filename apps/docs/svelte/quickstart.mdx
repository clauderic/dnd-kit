## Overview

The `@dnd-kit/svelte` package provides a set of Svelte primitives and components that you can use to build drag and drop interfaces. It is a thin Svelte integration layer built on top of the [vanilla](/overview) library, so all of the same concepts are shared and can be used. You can refer to the vanilla documentation of these concepts, such as [plugins](/extend/plugins), [modifiers](/extend/modifiers), and [sensors](/extend/sensors).

<Note>
  `@dnd-kit/svelte` requires Svelte 5.29 or later.
</Note>

## Installation
Before getting started, make sure you install `@dnd-kit/svelte` in your project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install @dnd-kit/svelte
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @dnd-kit/svelte
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add @dnd-kit/svelte
  ```

  ```bash bun
  bun add @dnd-kit/svelte
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Making elements draggable

Let's get started by creating draggable elements that can be dropped over droppable targets. To do so, we'll be using the `createDraggable` primitive.

The `createDraggable` primitive requires a unique `id`. It returns an object with an `attach` function that you can use with the `{@attach}` directive to connect an element to the drag system.

```svelte
<script>
  import {createDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/svelte';

  const draggable = createDraggable({id: 'draggable'});
</script>

<button {@attach draggable.attach}>
  Draggable
</button>
```

## Creating droppable elements

In order for our draggable elements to have targets where they can be dropped, we need to create droppable elements. To do so, we'll be using the `createDroppable` primitive.

Like `createDraggable`, the `createDroppable` primitive requires a unique `id`.

```svelte
<script>
  import {createDroppable} from '@dnd-kit/svelte';

  const droppable = createDroppable({id: 'droppable'});
</script>

<div {@attach droppable.attach} style="width: 300px; height: 300px;">
  Droppable
</div>
```

## Putting all the pieces together

Now that we have both draggable and droppable elements, we can put them together to create a simple drag and drop interaction.

We'll be using the `DragDropProvider` component to wrap our draggable and droppable elements. This component handles the drag and drop interactions and allows us to listen to drag and drop events.

```svelte App.svelte
<script>
  import {DragDropProvider, createDraggable, createDroppable} from '@dnd-kit/svelte';

  let parent = $state(undefined);

  const draggable = createDraggable({id: 'draggable'});
  const droppable = createDroppable({id: 'droppable'});

  function onDragEnd(event) {
    if (event.canceled) return;
    parent = event.operation.target?.id;
  }
</script>

<DragDropProvider {onDragEnd}>
  {#if parent == null}
    <button {@attach draggable.attach}>Draggable</button>
  {/if}

  <div {@attach droppable.attach} style="width: 300px; height: 300px;">
    {#if parent === 'droppable'}
      <button {@attach draggable.attach}>Draggable</button>
    {/if}
  </div>
</DragDropProvider>
```
