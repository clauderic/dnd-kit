## Overview

The `AutoScroller` plugin automatically scrolls scrollable containers when the pointer approaches their edges during a drag operation. It works in conjunction with the internal `Scroller` plugin that detects scrollable ancestors and computes scroll intent.

This plugin is included by default when creating a new `DragDropManager`.

## Behavior

When a drag operation is in progress and the pointer is near the edge of a scrollable container, the `AutoScroller` will:

1. Detect the nearest scrollable ancestor of the element under the pointer.
2. Compute the scroll direction and speed based on the pointer's proximity to the edge.
3. Continuously scroll the container at the computed speed until the pointer moves away from the edge or the container can no longer scroll in that direction.

The scroll speed increases as the pointer gets closer to the edge of the container.

## Disabling

To disable auto-scrolling, omit the `AutoScroller` from the plugins array:

```ts
import {DragDropManager, Accessibility, Cursor, Feedback, PreventSelection} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager({
  plugins: [Accessibility, Cursor, Feedback, PreventSelection],
});
```
