## Overview

The `Accessibility` plugin provides screen reader support for drag and drop operations. It automatically manages ARIA attributes on draggable elements, provides screen reader instructions, and announces drag events via a live region.

This plugin is included by default when creating a new `DragDropManager`.

## Configuration

Use `Accessibility.configure()` to customize announcements, screen reader instructions, and other options:

```ts
import {DragDropManager, Accessibility} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager({
  plugins: (defaults) => [
    ...defaults,
    Accessibility.configure({
      announcements: {
        dragstart({operation: {source}}) {
          if (!source) return;
          return `Started dragging ${source.id}`;
        },
        dragover({operation: {source, target}}) {
          if (!source || !target) return;
          return `${source.id} is over ${target.id}`;
        },
        dragend({operation: {source, target}, canceled}) {
          if (!source) return;
          if (canceled) return `Dragging canceled`;
          return `Dropped ${source.id} on ${target?.id ?? 'nothing'}`;
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## ARIA Attributes

The plugin automatically sets the following attributes on draggable activator elements (the handle or, if no handle is set, the draggable element itself):

- `role="button"` — unless the element is already a `<button>` or has an explicit `role`
- `aria-roledescription="draggable"`
- `aria-describedby` — points to a hidden element containing screen reader instructions
- `aria-pressed` and `aria-grabbed` — reflect the current dragging state
- `aria-disabled` — reflects the disabled state of the draggable
- `tabindex="0"` — ensures the element is focusable (added when the element is not natively focusable)

## Default Announcements

The plugin ships with default announcements for the `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `dragend` events:

- **dragstart**: `"Picked up draggable item {id}."`
- **dragover** (over a target): `"Draggable item {id} was moved over droppable target {targetId}."`
- **dragover** (no target): `"Draggable item {id} is no longer over a droppable target."`
- **dragend** (dropped on target): `"Draggable item {id} was dropped over droppable target {targetId}"`
- **dragend** (canceled): `"Dragging was cancelled. Draggable item {id} was dropped."`
- **dragend** (no target): `"Draggable item {id} was dropped."`

## Default Screen Reader Instructions

The default instructions read:

> To pick up a draggable item, press the space bar. While dragging, use the arrow keys to move the item in a given direction. Press space again to drop the item in its new position, or press escape to cancel.

## Options

<ParamField path="announcements" type="Announcements">
  Custom announcement functions for drag events. Each function receives the event and the `DragDropManager` instance, and returns a string to announce (or `undefined` to skip the announcement).

  ```ts
  interface Announcements {
    dragstart: (event, manager) => string | undefined;
    dragmove?: (event, manager) => string | undefined;
    dragover?: (event, manager) => string | undefined;
    dragend: (event, manager) => string | undefined;
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="screenReaderInstructions" type="ScreenReaderInstructions">
  Custom screen reader instructions displayed in a visually hidden element that is referenced by `aria-describedby` on draggable activator elements.

  ```ts
  interface ScreenReaderInstructions {
    draggable: string;
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="debounce" type="number" default="500">
  The number of milliseconds to debounce announcement updates. Only `dragover` and `dragmove` announcements are debounced; `dragstart` and `dragend` announcements are dispatched immediately.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="id" type="string">
  A stable identifier used to generate the `id` attributes for the hidden description and live region elements. When not provided, a unique id is generated automatically. Useful when you need to reference these elements from outside the plugin.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="idPrefix" type="{description?: string; announcement?: string}">
  Custom prefixes for the generated element ids.

  Defaults to `{description: 'dnd-kit-description', announcement: 'dnd-kit-announcement'}`.
</ParamField>
