## Overview

The Pointer sensor responds to [Pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) for mouse, touch, and pen input. It is enabled by default in the [DragDropManager](/concepts/drag-drop-manager).

## Usage

```ts
import {DragDropManager} from '@dnd-kit/dom';
import {PointerSensor, PointerActivationConstraints} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

const manager = new DragDropManager({
  sensors: [
    PointerSensor.configure({
      activationConstraints: [
        // Start dragging after moving 5px
        new PointerActivationConstraints.Distance({value: 5}),
        // Or after holding for 200ms with 10px tolerance
        new PointerActivationConstraints.Delay({value: 200, tolerance: 10}),
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Activation Constraints

The Pointer sensor supports composable activation constraints through the `PointerActivationConstraints` class. Multiple constraints can be combined to create sophisticated activation behaviors.

### Distance Constraint

Activates dragging after the pointer moves a certain distance:

```ts
import {PointerActivationConstraints} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

PointerSensor.configure({
  activationConstraints: [
    new PointerActivationConstraints.Distance({
      // Required distance in pixels
      value: 5,
      // Optional tolerance - aborts if exceeded
      tolerance: 10,
    }),
  ],
});
```

The `tolerance` option defines a movement threshold that, if exceeded, will abort the activation. This is useful for distinguishing between intentional drags and accidental movements.

### Delay Constraint

Activates dragging after holding the pointer for a duration:

```ts
import {PointerActivationConstraints} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

PointerSensor.configure({
  activationConstraints: [
    new PointerActivationConstraints.Delay({
      // Required hold duration in ms
      value: 200,
      // Movement tolerance during delay (in pixels)
      tolerance: 5,
    }),
  ],
});
```

The `tolerance` option specifies how much the pointer can move during the delay period before the activation is aborted.

### Combining Constraints

Multiple constraints can be combined in an array. The drag operation activates when any constraint is satisfied:

```ts
PointerSensor.configure({
  activationConstraints: [
    // Activate after 200ms delay OR 5px movement
    new PointerActivationConstraints.Delay({value: 200, tolerance: 10}),
    new PointerActivationConstraints.Distance({value: 5}),
  ],
});
```

## Default Behavior

By default, the Pointer sensor uses different activation constraints based on the pointer type and context:

- **Mouse on handle**: Immediate activation
- **Touch**: 250ms delay with 5px tolerance
- **Text inputs**: 200ms delay with 0px tolerance
- **Other pointers**: 200ms delay with 10px tolerance + 5px distance

You can customize this behavior by providing a function that returns constraints based on the event and source:

```ts
import {PointerActivationConstraints} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

PointerSensor.configure({
  activationConstraints(event, source) {
    const {pointerType, target} = event;

    // Custom constraints based on pointer type
    switch (pointerType) {
      case 'mouse':
        return [
          new PointerActivationConstraints.Distance({value: 5}),
        ];
      case 'touch':
        return [
          new PointerActivationConstraints.Delay({value: 250, tolerance: 5}),
        ];
      default:
        return [
          new PointerActivationConstraints.Delay({value: 200, tolerance: 10}),
          new PointerActivationConstraints.Distance({value: 5}),
        ];
    }
  },
});
```

## API Reference

### Options

<ParamField path="activationConstraints" type="ActivationConstraints&lt;PointerEvent&gt; | (event: PointerEvent, source: Draggable) =&gt; ActivationConstraints&lt;PointerEvent&gt;">
  Configure when dragging should start using an array of constraint instances:

  ```ts
  import {PointerActivationConstraints} from '@dnd-kit/dom';

  // Array of constraint instances
  type ActivationConstraints<E extends Event> = ActivationConstraint<E>[];

  // Distance type
  type Distance = number | {x?: number; y?: number};

  // Distance constraint
  new PointerActivationConstraints.Distance({
    value: number;        // Required distance in pixels
    tolerance?: Distance; // Optional abort threshold
  });

  // Delay constraint
  new PointerActivationConstraints.Delay({
    value: number;        // Required duration in ms
    tolerance: Distance;  // Movement tolerance
  });
  ```

  Can be a fixed array of constraints or a function that returns constraints based on the event and source.
</ParamField>

### Built-in constraints

The `PointerActivationConstraints` class provides built-in constraint primitives. You can also create your own custom activation constraints by extending the `ActivationConstraint` class.

#### Distance

Activates dragging after the pointer moves a certain distance.

##### Options for `Distance`

<ParamField path="value" type="number" required>
  Required distance in pixels.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tolerance" type="number | {x?: number; y?: number}" optional>
  If specified, aborts activation if movement exceeds this threshold. Can be a number or an object with optional x and y properties.
</ParamField>

#### Delay

Activates dragging after holding the pointer for a duration.

##### Options

<ParamField path="value" type="number" required>
  Required hold duration in milliseconds.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tolerance" type="number | {x?: number; y?: number}" optional>
  Maximum movement allowed during delay. Can be a number or an object with optional x and y properties. Exceeding this aborts activation.
</ParamField>

### Events

The Pointer sensor handles these events:

- `pointerdown`: Initial pointer contact
- `pointermove`: Pointer movement
- `pointerup`: Pointer release

The sensor automatically binds listeners across all same-origin documents, enabling drag operations across same-origin iframes.

### Best Practices

1. Use appropriate constraints for different input types:
   - Shorter delays for mouse
   - Longer delays with tolerance for touch
   - Distance constraints for precision

2. Consider accessibility:
   - Don't rely solely on hover
   - Provide clear activation feedback
   - Support keyboard input via [KeyboardSensor](/extend/sensors/keyboard-sensor)
