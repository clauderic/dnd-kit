## Overview

The Pointer sensor responds to [Pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) for mouse, touch, and pen input. It is enabled by default in the [DragDropManager](/concepts/drag-drop-manager).

## Usage

```ts
import {DragDropManager} from '@dnd-kit/dom';
import {PointerSensor} from '@dnd-kit/dom/sensors';

const manager = new DragDropManager({
  sensors: [
    PointerSensor.configure({
      activationConstraints: {
        // Start dragging after moving 5px
        distance: {
          value: 5,
        },
        // Or after holding for 200ms
        delay: {
          value: 200,
          tolerance: 10,
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Activation Constraints

The Pointer sensor supports two types of activation constraints that can be used together:

### Distance Constraint

Activates dragging after the pointer moves a certain distance:

```ts
PointerSensor.configure({
  activationConstraints: {
    distance: {
      // Required distance in pixels
      value: 5,
      // Optional tolerance per axis
      tolerance: {
        x: 5,
        y: 0, // Restrict to vertical movement
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Delay Constraint

Activates dragging after holding the pointer for a duration:

```ts
PointerSensor.configure({
  activationConstraints: {
    delay: {
      // Required hold duration in ms
      value: 200,
      // Movement tolerance during delay
      tolerance: 5,
    },
  },
});
```

## Default Behavior

By default, the Pointer sensor uses different activation constraints based on the pointer type:

- **Mouse**: Immediate activation on drag handle
- **Touch**: 250ms delay with 5px tolerance
- **Other pointers**: 200ms delay with 5px distance threshold

You can customize this behavior:

```ts
PointerSensor.configure({
  activationConstraints(event, source) {
    const {pointerType, target} = event;

    // Custom constraints based on pointer type
    switch (pointerType) {
      case 'mouse':
        return {
          distance: {value: 5},
        };
      case 'touch':
        return {
          delay: {value: 250, tolerance: 5},
        };
      default:
        return {
          delay: {value: 200},
          distance: {value: 5},
        };
    }
  },
});
```

## API Reference

### Options

<ParamField path="activationConstraints" type="ActivationConstraints | ((event: PointerEvent, source: Draggable) => ActivationConstraints)">
  Configure when dragging should start:

  ```ts
  interface ActivationConstraints {
    // Distance-based activation
    distance?: {
      value: number;
      tolerance?: number | {x?: number; y?: number};
    };
    // Time-based activation
    delay?: {
      value: number;
      tolerance: number | {x?: number; y?: number};
    };
  }
  ```

  Can be a fixed configuration or a function that returns constraints based on the event and source.
</ParamField>

### Events

The Pointer sensor handles these events:

- `pointerdown`: Initial pointer contact
- `pointermove`: Pointer movement
- `pointerup`: Pointer release
- `lostpointercapture`: Lost pointer tracking

### Coordinates

The sensor provides pointer coordinates relative to the viewport:

```ts
{
  x: event.clientX, // Horizontal position
  y: event.clientY  // Vertical position
}
```

These coordinates are automatically adjusted for scroll position and zoom level.

### Best Practices

1. Use appropriate constraints for different input types:
   - Shorter delays for mouse
   - Longer delays with tolerance for touch
   - Distance constraints for precision

2. Consider accessibility:
   - Don't rely solely on hover
   - Provide clear activation feedback
   - Support keyboard input via [KeyboardSensor](/extend/sensors/keyboard-sensor)
