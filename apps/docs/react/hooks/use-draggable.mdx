The `useDraggable` hook requires an `id` and accepts all the same options as the `Draggable` class. Refer to the [Input](#input) section below for more information.

## API Reference

<Note>
  The `useDraggable` hook is a thin wrapper around the [Draggable](/concepts/draggable) class that makes it easier to create draggable elements in React. It therefore accepts all of the same input arguments.
</Note>

### Input

The `useDraggable` hook accepts the following arguments:

<ParamField path="id" type="string | number" required>
  The identifier of the draggable element. Should be unique within the same [drag and drop context provider](/react/components/drag-drop-provider).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="string | number | Symbol">
  Optionally supply a type to only allow this draggable element to be dropped over droppable targets that [accept](/concepts/droppable) this `type`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="element" type="Element | Ref<Element>">
  If you already have a reference to the element, you can pass it to the `element` option instead of using the `ref` that is returned by the `useDraggable` hook to connect the draggable source element.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="handle" type="Element | Ref<Element>">
  If you already have a reference to the drag handle element, you can pass it to the `handle` option instead of using the `handleRef` that is returned by the `useDraggable` hook to connect the drag handle element.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="disabled" type="boolean">
  Set to `true` to prevent the draggable element from being draggable.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="feedback" type="'default' | 'clone' | 'move' | 'none'">
  The type of feedback that should be displayed when the element is being dragged.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="modifiers" type="Modifier[]">
  An array of [modifiers](/plugins/modifiers) that can be used to modify or restrict the behavior of the draggable element.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sensors" type="Sensors[]">
  An array of [sensors](/sensors/overview) that can be bound to the draggable element to detect drag interactions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="data" type="{[key: string]: any}">
  The data argument is for advanced use-cases where you may need access to additional data about the draggable element in event handlers, modifiers, sensors or custom plugins.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="effects" type="(manager: DragDropManager) => Effect[]">
  <Info>This is an advanced feature and should not need to be used by most consumers.</Info>
  You can supply a function that returns an array of reactive effects that can be set up and automatically cleaned up when the component invoking the `useDraggable` hook element is unmounted.
</ParamField>

### Output

The `useDraggable` hook returns an object containing the following properties:

<ResponseField name="ref" type="(element: Element) => void">
  A [ref callback function](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#ref-callback) that can be attached to the element that you want to make draggable.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="handleRef" type="(element: Element) => void">
  A [ref callback function](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#ref-callback) that can be attached to an element to create a drag handle.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isDragSource" type="boolean">
  A boolean value that indicates whether the draggable is the source of the drag operation that is in progress.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isDragging" type="boolean">
  A boolean value that indicates whether the draggable is currently being dragged.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="isDropping" type="boolean">
  A boolean value that indicates whether the draggable is being dropped. This can be used to style the draggable element differently during the drop animation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="draggable" type="Draggable">
  The [draggable](concepts/draggable) instance that is created by the `useDraggable` hook.
</ResponseField>

## Guides

### Specifying a drag handle

To specify a drag handle, provide a reference to an element and pass it as the `handle` argument to the `useDraggable` hook. Alternatively, you can consume the `handleRef` ref callback to connect the drag handle element.

```jsx
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function Draggable(props) {
  const {ref, handleRef} = useDraggable({
    id: props.id,
  });

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      Draggable
      <button ref={handleRef}>Drag handle</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  When you connect a drag handle element, only the element that is connected to the `handleRef` will initiate the drag operation.
</Note>

### Restricting dragging using modifiers

Use [modifiers](/plugins/modifiers) to modify or restrict the behavior of draggable elements.

Modifiers let you dynamically modify the movement coordinates that are detected by sensors. They can be used for a wide range of use cases, for example:

- Restricting motion to a single axis
- Restricting motion to the draggable node container's bounding rectangle
- Restricting motion to the draggable node's scroll container bounding rectangle
- Applying resistance or clamping the motion

Modifiers can be applied globally on the [&lt;DragDropProvider&gt;](/react/components/drag-drop-provider) component or locally on individual draggable elements.

Here is an example of how to restrict dragging to the horizontal axis:

```jsx
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/react';
import {RestrictToHorizontalAxis} from '@dnd-kit/abstract/modifiers';

function Draggable({id}) {
  const {ref} = useDraggable({
    id,
    modifiers: [RestrictToHorizontalAxis],
  });
}
```

<Story id="react-draggable-modifiers--horizontal-axis" height="130" />

And here is an example of how to restrict dragging to the container element of the draggable:

```jsx
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/react';
import {RestrictToElement} from '@dnd-kit/dom/modifiers';

function Draggable({id}) {
  const {ref} = useDraggable({
    id,
    modifiers: [RestrictToElement.configure({element: document.body})],
  });
}
```

<Story id="react-draggable-modifiers--container-modifier" height="500" />

export const app = `
import {Draggable} from './Draggable.js';
import './styles.css';

export default function App() {
  return <Draggable id="draggable"/>;
}
`.trim();

export const code = `
import {useDraggable} from '@dnd-kit/react';

export function Draggable(props) {
  const {ref} = useDraggable({
    id: props.id,
  });

  return <button ref={ref} className="btn">draggable</button>;
}
`.trim();

### Rendering a drag overlay

You can render a completely different element while the draggable element is being dragged by using the `<DragOverlay>` component.

<img src="/images/draggable/drag-overlay.png" />

```jsx
import {useDraggable, DragOverlay} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function Draggable() {
  const {ref} = useDraggable({
    id: 'draggable',
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button ref={ref}>
        Draggable
      </button>
      <DragOverlay>
        <div>I will be rendered while dragging...</div>
      </DragOverlay>
    </>
  );
}
```

The `<DragOverlay>` component will only render its children when a drag operation is in progress. This can be useful for rendering a completely different element while the draggable element is being dragged.

<Warning>
 You should only render the `<DragOverlay>` component once per [DragDropProvider](/react/components/drag-drop-provider) component.
</Warning>

To get around the fact that the `<DragOverlay>` component should only rendered once, you can also pass a function as a child to the `<DragOverlay>` component, which will receive the `source` as an argument. This can be useful for rendering a clone of the source element while it is being dragged.

```jsx
import {useDraggable, DragOverlay} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function App(props) {
  return (
    <DragDropProvider>
      <Draggable id="foo" />
      <Draggable id="bar" />
      <DragOverlay>
        {source => (
          <div>
            Dragging {source.id}
          </div>
        )}
      </DragOverlay>
    </DragDropProvider>
  );
}
```
