# Droppable

Create droppable targets for draggable elements.

<Preview of={Hero} hero />

## Usage

Use the `useDroppable` hook to create droppable targets that `draggable` elements can be dropped over.

```jsx
import {useDroppable} from '@dnd-kit/react';

function Droppable(props) {
  const {ref} = useDroppable({
    id: props.id,
  });

  return <div ref={ref}>{props.children}</div>;
}
```

On its own, the `useDroppable` hook does not provide a lot of functionality. It is meant to be used in conjunction with the `useDraggable` hook, along with a parent `<DragDropProvider>` component to listen for and respond to drag and drop events.

You can set up as many droppable targets as needed, either by calling the `useDroppable` hook multiple times within the same component, or by setting up a generic component that calls `useDroppable` and rendering that component multiple times. Just remember to make sure they all have a unique `id` so that they can be differentiated.

## Getting started

To get started, we will create three files, `App.js`, `Droppable.js`, and `Draggable.js`.

<Preview
  code={[ExampleSource, DroppableSource, DraggableSource]}
  tabs={['App.js', 'Droppable.js', 'Draggable.js']}
>
  <Example />
</Preview>

To render multiple droppable targets, we can simply render the `<Droppable>` component multiple times:

<Preview code={[MultipleDroppableExampleSource]} tabs={['App.js']}>
  <MultipleDroppableExample />
</Preview>
