Allow setting an optional `id` prop on `DndContext` to fix a warning during server-side rendering (especially in Next.js). By default, this `id` is autogenerated and can lead to a mismatch between the server- and client-side rendered HTML. We also avoid this mismatch by rendering the `Accessibility` component only after everything else was initially mounted on the client.
