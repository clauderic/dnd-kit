#### Regrouping accessibility-related props

Accessibility-related props have been regrouped under the `accessibility` prop of `<DndContext>`:

```diff
<DndContext
- announcements={customAnnouncements}
- screenReaderInstructions={customScreenReaderInstructions}
+ accessibility={{
+  announcements: customAnnouncements,
+  screenReaderInstructions: customScreenReaderInstructions,
+ }}
```

This is a breaking change that will allow easier addition of new accessibility-related features without overloading the props namespace of `<DndContext>`.

#### Accessibility-related DOM nodes are no longer portaled by default

The DOM nodes for the screen reader instructions and announcements are no longer portaled into the `document.body` element by default.

This change is motivated by the fact that screen readers do not always announce ARIA live regions that are rendered on the `document.body`. Common examples of this include when rendering a `<DndContext>` within a `<dialog>` element or an element that has `role="dialog"`, only ARIA live regions rendered within the dialog will be announced.

Consumers can now opt to render announcements in the portal container of their choice using the `container` property of the `accessibility` prop:

```diff
<DndContext
+ accessibility={{
+  container: document.body,
+ }}
```
