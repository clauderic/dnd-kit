# Touch

The Touch sensor responds to [Touch events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events). Touch events offer the ability to interpret finger or stylus activity on touch screens or trackpads.

### Activator

The touch activator is the `onTouchStart` event handler. The Touch sensor is initialized if the there is no more than a single touch on the [`event.touches`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/touches) property.

### Activation constraints

Like the [Pointer](pointer) sensor, the Touch sensor has two activation constraints:

- Distance constraint
- Delay constraint

These activation constraints are mutually exclusive and may not be used simultaneously.

#### Distance

The distance constraint subscribes to the following interface:

```typescript
interface DistanceConstraint {
  distance: number;
}
```

The `distance` property represents the distance, in _pixels_, by which the touch input needs to be moved before a drag start event is emitted.

#### Delay

The delay constraint subscribe to the following interface:

```typescript
interface DelayConstraint {
  delay: number;
  tolerance: number;
}
```

The `delay` property represents the duration, in _milliseconds_, that a draggable item needs to be held by the touch input before a drag start event is emitted.

The `tolerance` property represents the distance, in _pixels_, of motion that is tolerated before the drag operation is aborted. If the finger or stylus is moved during the delay duration and the tolerance is set to zero, the drag operation will be immediately aborted. If a higher tolerance is set, for example, a tolerance of `5` pixels, the operation will only be aborted if the finger is moved by more than 5 pixels during the delay.

This property is particularly useful for touch input, where some tolerance should be accounted for when using a delay constraint, as touch input is less precise than mouse input.

### Recommendations

#### `touch-action`

We highly recommend you specify the `touch-action` CSS property for all of your draggable elements.

> The **`touch-action`** CSS property sets how an element's region can be manipulated by a touchscreen user \(for example, by zooming features built into the browser\).

In general, we recommend you set the `touch-action` property to `none` for draggable elements in order to prevent scrolling on mobile devices.

<Callout>
For [Touch Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events), there is no way to prevent the default behaviour of the browser on touch devices when interacting with a draggable element from the pointer event listeners. Using `touch-action: none;` is the only way to reliably prevent scrolling for pointer events.

Further, using `touch-action: none;` is currently the only reliable way to prevent scrolling in iOS Safari for both Touch and Pointer events.

</Callout>

If your draggable item is part of a scrollable list, we recommend you use a drag handle and set `touch-action` to `none` only for the drag handle, so that the contents of the list can still be scrolled, but that initiating a drag from the drag handle does not scroll the page.

Once a `pointerdown` or `touchstart` event has been initiated, any changes to the `touch-action` value will be ignored. Programmatically changing the `touch-action` value for an element from `auto` to `none` after a pointer or touch event has been initiated will not result in the user agent aborting or suppressing any default behavior for that event for as long as that pointer is active \(for more details, refer to the [Pointer Events Level 2 Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents2/#determining-supported-touch-behavior)\).
